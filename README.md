## Description

Based around a large industrial site or number of remote sites. On these sites, key pieces of equipment have metrics recorded,  hours running, temperature tank level etc. 
On a walk around an operator logged into the app can scan a QR code attached to that piece of equipment.  
The key metrics from the instruments associated with that piece of equipment would then be shown on the app.
